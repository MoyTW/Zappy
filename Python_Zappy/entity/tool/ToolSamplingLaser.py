'''
    Can trigger collapses, break open pits, etc, etc, from a longer range than the Waldos and with greater force. Can
also do thinks like kill weak enemies, blind average ones, and irritate powerful and terrifying ones.

How to manage?
    - If enemy, check strength (I need to add this in). Then, apply status effect.
    - Instead of "triggering" Environmentals, it "attacks" them.
