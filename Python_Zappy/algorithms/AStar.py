# This is an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.
#
# It is designed to be usable in as many different situations as possible, with as many different types of nodes as
# possible. Therefore, it does not directly manipulate any of the data, and may be used with any data format the user
# would like. For example, this code may be used with a standard 2-D grid of cells which can be traversed diagonally,
# a grid of hexes, a navigation mesh, or any arbitrary graph.
#
# However, this flexibility means that it does not touch the underlying data, and therefore the user must define the
# following functions:
#
#   A function which determines what nodes are adjacent to any given node with the following signature:
#       iterable<node_coordinate> f(node_coordinate)
#
#   A function to calculate the move cost for moving to an adjacent node with the following signature:
#       int f(node_coordinate, node_coordinate)
#           Note that the order in which the adjacent nodes are presented will change the bias of the algorithm! In case
#           of ties in f-values between two options, it will go with the first presented, which is the first option
#           from this function.
#
#   A function which determines whether a given node is passable with the following signature:
#       bool f(node_coordinate)
#
#   A function which estimates the movement cost between two given nodes with the following signature:
#       int f(node_coordinate, node_coordinate)
#
# Given these functions, find_path() will return a tuple of coordinates (in whatever format you supplied them)
# indicating the path to be taken from the origin to the destination.


# Returns a tuple of coordinates, from the origin to the destination.
